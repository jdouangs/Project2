        <h3>Summary/Objective</h3>
        <p>The purpose of the project was to observe average hourly earnings data sourced from the U.S. <a href="http://www.bls.gov">Bureau of Labor Statistics </a> and to determine
            if there were any identifiable trends across different types of industries based off of region or year. Our objective was also to determine if any key historical economic events 
            in the past decade had any impact on or coincided with the observed trends. Definitions for each industry can be found at the bottom of the page.

            <h3>Analysis of Each Industry by State in 2017</h3>
            <p>An analysis of the choropleth maps reveals the following insights for each industry in 2017:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Construction</b> average hourly wages were higher ($35+) in NY, IL, NJ, MA and AL compared to other states. Areas that had the lowest wages ($20-$25) in the industry were the U.S. South, VT, MA, ID and NM.</li>
                <li>The states with the highest average hourly wages in the <b>Finance</b> industry were CA, IL, MN as well as the Northeast region of the U.S.</li>
                <li>Although there is no data for most states, average hourly wages appear to be the highest for the <b>Information</b> sector in the East and West Coast regions of the U.S. The map also displays wage ranges of $30-$34 in IL, MI, PA, TN, and UT.</li>
                <li>Although <b>Leisure and Hospitality</b> has the lowest average hourly earnings, states on the East and West Coasts still had higher values compared to the rest of the U.S.</li>
                <li>Average hourly wages appear to be evenly distributed for the <b>Manufacturing</b>, <b>Professional Services</b>, and <b>Trade</b> Sectors. Wages are slightly higher for Manufacturing in the Southern/Midwest region, and WA appearing to be the highest paying state. CA, NY, VA, WA, MA, and CT are the highest paying states for Professional Services.</li>

            <h3>Analysis of Each Industry Over the Period 2008 - 2018</h3>
            <p>
             With average hourly wages adjusted for inflation, wages experienced a slight decrease from 2009 to 2013 and then increased from 2014 to 2017 for all industries except Information. A slight decrease in wages is shown among all industries from 2017 to 2018. Overall, the increases/decreases were minimal and displayed stagnant wage growth from 2009 to 2018.  The Mining & Logging Industry showed a more drastic pattern where average hourly wages decreased from 2009 to 2011 and then increased for subsequent years before flattening out in 2014 and then decreasing from 2015 onwards. The Information sector showed positive wage growth on an annual basis before displaying a slight decrease from 2017 to 2018.

            <h3>Annual Comparison of Industries</h3>
            <p>
                When comparing industries against each other for an annual time period, not much change was shown among each industry as the Information sector still remained the highest paying industry on an average hourly basis. Leisure & Hospitality remained the lowest paying sector on an average hourly basis and amounting to less than half of what the average is for the Information sector ($12.55 vs. $29.85). Although there hasn't been drastic changes year-over-year, there has been a move forward for the Financial industry and Profession & Business Services. The Financial industry has moved from the fourth highest paying industry on an average hourly basis in 2008 to the second highest paying in 2018.

            <h3>Timeline of Key Events</h3>
            <p>
                Over 2 million jobs were lost in 2009 after therecession. The Fed reports that U.S. families on average lost 18% of their wealth. The unemployment rate hit 10% in 2009. In July 2014, Seattle raised its minimum wage to $15/hr, making it the city with the highest minimum wage in the U.S. This event may help in explaining why WA tends to have high average hourly earnings in many of the industries examined on the choropleth maps such as Information, Leisure, Manufacturing, and Professional Services. In 2014, the federal minimum wage increased from $7.25 to $10.10. Unemployment was at 5% in November 2015, making it the lowest before the Great Recession. President Donald Trump's executive orders during 2017 were themed around a push for trade and a preference for utilization of oil and fossil fuels.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                In conclusion, average hourly wages in 2017 tended to be higher on the West Coast and Northeast regions of the U.S. plus Illinois for most industries while the trade industry had a more even distribution across states. From an overall standpoint 2008–2018, average hourly wages in the United States have tended to decrease among all sectors except Information during and after the Recession only to change course and increase over time around 2014 to 2018. This is around the same time the federal government raised its minimum wage by approximately $3 and 20 states followed suit in wage increases. Wages may have been impacted by recession and post-recession periods when adjusted for inflation, and government decision may have possibly had an impact on determining the hourly averagely hour wages for each year.
